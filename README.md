# Bitcoin-Core-Design-Foundations [WIP] 

Currently there lacks design foundations within Bitcoin Core making it difficult on-boarding new designers as well as merging of the design and development process. This has created a catch-22 situation for contributing designs to Bitcoin Core, as designers are unlikely to create designs if there is no developer to implement them and vice versa for developers implementing designs with limited designer guidance. Establishing some design foundations will help remediate this issue and ultimately result in making software such as the Bitcoin Core GUI more accessible to your average user.

My design philosophy for core is to find a middle ground between technical prowess and a clean user experience that beginner users can be intuitively guided through. I do not see core (or more specifically the GUI) as being a flashy node product like umbrel or mynode, but rather a Swiss-army knife of sorts that has various tools that can cater to a wide range of users needs whether technical or beginner. The Bitcoin Core community has done / is doing some phenomenal work for Bitcoin and I believe with good design on their side can be a driving force for implementing new features, terminology and practices to the wider Bitcoin ecosystem.

This document will be updated and grow as projects finish and time goes.

## Goals
The primary goal is to bridge the gap between the Bitcoin Core community and the Bitcoin Design community by establishing solid foundations that developers and designers can build upon. 

### General goals
- Establish a design system for Bitcoin Core to:
  - Assist with on-boarding new designers and developers.
  - Streamline the design and development process and contribution.
  
- Contribute incremental, conservative but impactful UI/UX changes to the Bitcoin Core GUI. This will help establish design flows that will be apart of the design system. 
  
- Be an active design focused PR reviewer for the Bitcoin Core GUI repo.

- Keeping dialogues going between developers and designers around UI/UX decisions. 

- Represent end users in many conversations on GitHub / IRC / Slack that shape the Bitcoin Core GUI. 

- Collaborate with Bitcoin Core design researchers such as Jamaal when desiging for the GUI. [Jamaalâ€™s Project Horizon.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z2D1Wn5tkQ-Scdp0n8qm2mnFvik1wnU3vcu1DZ1f9jo/edit#)

- Apply what I learn working on designs with Bitcoin Core to the [Bitcoin Design Guide.](https://github.com/BitcoinDesign/Guide)
  - An example being the section on Open Design. Insights gained from implementing designs within Core will likely be useful.

## Timeline
Looking to have solid design foundations established for Bitcoin Core over the next 6 months a long with many UI/UX improvements implemented. Implementation is difficult to gauge as its restricted to the pace of Core, which historically is quite conservative. Though it is common for design decisions to be ahead of development changes, so I will continue making / improving on designs that developers can pick up when they have time.

## Active work
Below is what I am actively working on for Bitcoin Core. Many of these have been broken up into smaller versions to limit technical debt and align with the conservative and incremental way in which Bitcoin Core is developed.

### Bitcoin Core design system v1.0
A design system will be pivotal in on-boarding new designers and making the design implementation process more seamless. v1.0 will only focus on branding and content guidelines as well as provide a resources library for things like figma files, templates, a glossary, guides, presentation kits and designer workflows.

Aiming to develop this design system using the react based design system builder [Catalog](https://www.catalog.style/). A repo anyone can contribute to will be available soon. I chose Catalog because is quite intuitive to use so non-technical designers should not have an issue contributing. Furthermore, many designers are also familiar with web frame works like React making more technical changes easier to do.

### [GUI on-boarding wizard designs v1.0](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/issues/81)
This design aims to re-work the currently very limited on-boarding process around setting up your core node. Currently users are thrown into the GUI with very little guidance as to what is going on.

### [GUI create wallet designs v1.0](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/issues/77#issue-687141626)     
- This design aims to clean up the current create wallet user flow by adding clearer descriptions of things like the wallet types and details around encrypting your private keys. 

### [Bitcoin Core Figma account](https://www.figma.com/file/FJ02rY3m8V9ZCDvoXjW39W/Bitcoin-Core?node-id=25%3A569)

I'm exploring having a 'Bitcoin Core' Figma account ([here](https://www.figma.com/@atlassian) is an example of an entity based figma account) that manages a set of master pages that include things like a style guide, designer workflows, current active designs, icons, components, community contributed art etc.

Community members can create a remix (figma community feature) of these master pages to use as a reference and work on their own designs. This kind of acts like a GitHub 'branch' of the master page. Remixs of pages are shown under the master page ([see here](https://www.figma.com/community/file/775423808468574409)) so if someone wants to see what community members are working on they can browse through the various remix's.

This account would have a maintainer(s) who can update the master pages as needed. An issue with this approach is it is hard to keep track of what is updated (version control isn't that great, paid Figma does it better, need to explore this further though) and when and by who (maintainers could change what they want at will). Everyone would have their own 'fork' (in the form of a remix) though, so if anything major contentious changes are made community members could speak out and switch to the appropriate 'fork' if a consensus is met. Discussions will on GitHub repo that is dedicated Bitcoin Core Design as to not divide designer and developer input.

### Designer documentation
Write a design_process.md file to merge into core, similar to the translation_process.md file which outlines how to contribute translations to core. This will be a blend of the design workflow as well as some general GH housekeeping rules to follow. 

Icon policy documentation on how to contribute / implement icons into the GUI repo - this will be for both developers and designers. 

[Design workflow documentation](https://www.figma.com/file/si2C2uAPyGUHrvdnkJtmI5/Bitcoin-Core-Figma-Workflow?node-id=718%3A369). This will be included in GitHub, figma and the design system.

### Designer guides
All guides will be moved from Medium to my own self-hosted site soon. They will also be published on my GitHub account within an appropriate repo (likely the Bitcoin Core Design repo mentioned in the Bitcoin Core Figma account discussion above). 

- Compiling the Bitcoin Core GUI from source for designers. One guide for each major OS ([Windows](https://medium.com/@_Bosch_/compiling-the-bitcoin-core-gui-from-source-for-designers-windowsos-1e73f478a799), [macOS](https://medium.com/@_Bosch_/compiling-the-bitcoin-core-gui-from-source-for-designers-macos-7ef2e1c6d8b0), [Linux](https://medium.com/@_Bosch_/compiling-the-bitcoin-core-gui-from-source-for-designers-linux-936ed2fca125)).

- Create a design issue template for GUI repo. This will help designers provide the right details of their designs so they get appropriate feedback from the community, especially developers.

### Design discussions
Many Bitcoin Core design discussions may never go anywhere for various technical / historical / philosophical reasons. However, it's important to have historical context so that future designers getting involved do not repeat the same questions. Below are some discussions I've started / will start that may or may not be feasible but are worth being discussed for future reference. This list will grow as time goes on. I will summarise these discussions here as well as on the Bitcoin Stack exchange and Bitcointalk where relevant. 

- [Bitcoin Core Branding](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/issues/89).

- Establishing a Bitcoin Core design system.

- Switching from Qt Widgets to Qt QML for the GUI. Qt widgets has many design restraints that make it difficult for designers to make changes to. Switching to QML gives more flexibility design wise. Furthermore, widgets incurs more technical debt as many changes will be OS specific and make look bad on other OS's requiring much more testing / reviewing / designing. 

- Having HWI installed with the GUI binaries. Currently users have to install HWI separately and set the HWI path in the GUI settings. HWI downloaded and installed as part of the download process may resolve this UX issue. 

- Switching net's within the gui [issue #78](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/issues/78)

- Splitting the GUI / CLI into separate binaries. End users don't need the CLI so why should they download it? An example of a project that does this is [Monero](https://www.getmonero.org/downloads/). 

- Shipping the GUI with Tor binaries that execute on launching. Currently users need to have Tor running before the 'default Tor mode' works out of the box. Many users are likely to not have Tor downloaded but turn on the default Tor option giving them a false sense of privacy. Shipping with the GUI would improve UX around this. 

### Minor design work
Here are some minor design decions I have made / in the process of making. Please view my Github for a deeper dive on discussions / suggestions I've made.

- Added a Tor icon for when all network connections are through the Tor network [issue #58](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/issues/58) / [PR #86](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pull/86)

- Some minor changes to the create wallet section of the GUI [PR #96](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pull/96)

- Privacy mode toggle option [issue #82](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/issues/82)

- More informative tray icons [issue #70](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/issues/70)

## Planned / early stage projects

### Bitcoin Core design system v2.0

This will build on v1.0 and focus on components and patterns as well as foundations like colors, iconography, accessibility and typography. I am currently holding off working on these sections due to the discussions being had around switching from [Qt Widgets to Qt QML](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16883) which have very different design constraints and will determine what direction to take for these parts of the design system. 

### GUI on-boarding designs v2.0
v2.0 will focus on implementing the create wallet flow (v.1.0 and v2.0) alongside setting up your node. This will include hardware wallet integration and the ability to make watch-only wallets by importing descriptors.  

### GUI create wallet designs v2.0
v2.0 will extend the v1.0 designs by adding hardware wallet UI as well as the ability to import various descriptors such as xpubx for watch only-wallets. This will be designed alongside GUI on-boarding v2.0 as much of the flow will also be apart of on-boarding 2.0. 

### GUI internal designs for HWI
This will likely occur in parallel to v2.0 of the create wallet designs which integrates HWI UI when creating a wallet. This will include things like signing tx's within the GUI using a hardware wallet. 

### GUI Qt QML designs
This is a major project that will likely involve a big face lift of the GUI. However, switching to QML from widgets is still being discussed so this is on hold until that discussion unfolds. ([WIP PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16883)). It's likely I will have the design system fleshed out by the time serious QML integration begins which I will apply to these designs. 

### GUI multi signature designs
Once I have the basic create wallet flow UI with HWI developing multisig UI is my next priority. 

### GUI CoinControl re-design
Some great discussions and work happening over at the Bitcoin Design community on improving CoinControl UX. Will be implementing this work into the GUI once it is more establishedâ€”https://github.com/BitcoinDesign/Guide/issues/22. 

### Make an icon library for the GUI
This is a project I will likely collaborate with the Bitcoin design community on. The primary aim is to create an open source icon library that Bitcoin Core, as well as other Bitcoin wallets, can use. Ideally it would be great to have this as its own repo in Bitcoin Core that people can easily clone / modify outside of the GUI repo. 

### Do design work on bitcoincore.org
The user journey does not start once the user downloads the GUI but rather the website its downloaded from, or rather how the user gets to the website itself. I will be applying the Bitcoin Core design system to the website a long with making it more clear what it is the GUI offers (currently it is isn't quite clear on the site). Cobra (owner or bitcoin.org) is also working on a [Bitcoin wallet](https://twitter.com/cobrabitcoin/status/1310304498125025282?s=21) which could mean a conflict of interest. This is one of many reasons Bitcoincore.org should be the primary place to download core.  

### Develop user guides
The GUI can be complicated for users to navigate and some features are still primarily RPC based. I will be creating simple how-to guides for certain features of the GUI that will give simple explanations for technical topics. I will create a list below as I develop and publish ideas.
