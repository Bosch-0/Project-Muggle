# üßô‚Äç What is Project Muggle? 
Project Muggle is an initiative started in the [Bitcoin Design community](https://github.com/BitcoinDesign) to improve the design focus of applications developed by the [Bitcoin Core project](https://bitcoincore.org/). The Bitcoin Core project maintains and releases an open source Bitcoin client called ‚Äú[Bitcoin Core](https://github.com/bitcoin).‚Äù Bitcoin Core is (currently) the primary reference implementation for the digital currency Bitcoin (BTC).  

Bitcoin has yet to break out of the non-magical community (programming wizards) into the world of ordinary human beings (muggles). Design is one way to help bridge this gap and make the magical internet money known as bitcoin more accessible to the average person.

This repo will keep track of efforts made in improving the design focus of Bitcoin Core. If you wish to collaborate on Project Muggle reach out on the [Bitcoin Design Slack](https://bitcoindesign.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-gytq2snl-4TEWJOTKrXRCB4YLBoDunA#/) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/_bosch_). 



# üèÜ Goal of Project Muggle 
Establish design foundations and direction for Bitcoin Core by the 22.0 release (~July 2021). 


### What will this achieve?

- Better UI/UX for current and future users of Bitcoin Core products such as the GUI / website. 
- More design focused contributors / stronger design contribution process within Bitcoin Core.
- Save time and resources by reducing developmental debt - both technical and design.
- Assist with establishing Bitcoin open design processes and standards that help the wider Bitcoin ecosystem. 



# What is Project Muggle working on? 
## üåå Bitcoin Core Design system
A design system has many definitions, though the Nielsen Norman Group's definition below is quite accurate:

> Design Systems‚Äîalso known as 'pattern libraries' or 'component  libraries'‚Äîpromote quality, consistent UX design across products; and  expedite the work of designers, developers, and anyone else working on a  website, application, or any digital design.

Project Muggle will initially establish two Figma native design systems for Bitcoin Core. One for the [GUI](https://www.figma.com/file/0oqnohjahRtprjRyaetDOL/GUI-Design-System?node-id=1830%3A608) and one for [bitcoincore.org](https://www.figma.com/file/k30cNrPIUybQ8rpvuDF60Q/Website-Design-System?node-id=6%3A0). These two files will be hosted by a [BitcoinCore Figma account](https://www.figma.com/@BitcoinCore). Governence of this account will also have to be established. Having a design system will be assist with on-boarding new designers and will significantly speed up the developing, contributing and testing of designs.

Two will exist initially due to the constraints of the Qt widgets framework currently used by the GUI, which uses native OS styling making a custom design system challenging. The GUI design system will be built around these constraints, whilst the bitcoincore.org design system will introduce a whole new custom look and feel. It's likely the GUI will transition to using the more flexible Qt framework QML (discussions currently underway) in the near future of which the design system built for bitcoincore.org will be applied to a new custom QML based design. 

To see how designers will work with these design systems a [README](https://www.figma.com/file/0oqnohjahRtprjRyaetDOL/?node-id=271%3A527) at the start of each design system outlining workflows has been included.

A single, full fledged design system including design and code snippets will eventually be hosted on GitHub pages through a live, interactive web app.



## üåê Bitcoincore.org redesign 
Project Muggle will be working on a complete re-design of bitcoincore.org using our Bitcoin Core website design system outlined above. 

Bitcoincore.org currently has a dated and not so user friendly design. User journey's do not start with running an application. In the case of the GUI downloading the binaries from a trusted source such as bitcoincore.org is a first step. The current design does not communicate trust nor does it do a good job educating users about Bitcoin Core and what it offers. A re-design that puts emphasis on user experience and trust will significantly improve how users view Bitcoin Core and its associated products. [Active design](https://www.figma.com/file/4dO1LqPY0WAgp5d1Bz3U8j/?node-id=110%3A0) work will begin once the website design system is established. 



## üü† Open source Bitcoin icon library
Project Muggle will be developing an open source bitcoin centric icon library that projects like Bitcoin Core can use in their applications. This will be an open initiative that Project Muggle and the wider Bitcoin Design community will collaboratively work on.

## üìô Contributing to Bitcoin Design Guide
Project Muggle will be contributing what we learn through working on Bitcoin Core to the open source [Bitcoin Design Guide](https://github.com/BitcoinDesign/Guide). Learnings obtained through working on Bitcoin Core will likely make valuable additions to the "Open source & open design" section of the Guide among others.

> The Bitcoin Design Guide is a free open-source community resource that helps designers, developers and others working on non-custodial bitcoin-products to create better experiences, faster. We hope that, over time, it will cover all relevant types of products, including consumer wallets, merchant interactions, exchanges and more. Better products and experiences should ultimately make it more appealing for anyone to own and use bitcoin.



## ‚òéÔ∏è Bi-weekly Bitcoin Core Design Review Calls
Project Muggle, along with the Bitcoin Design community, hosts bi-weekly Bitcoin Core design review calls. The goal of these calls is to bridge the designer and developer gap and keep the design community up to date with whats going on design and development wise on Bitcoin Core, including work Project Muggle is doing. Scheduled calls can be found in the issues section in the [BitcoinDesign/Meta repo](https://github.com/BitcoinDesign).



## üõ†Ô∏è Bitcoin Core GUI pull request (PR) testing
A major development bottleneck for the Bitcoin Core project is the limited amount of PR testers. This issue is amplified with the GUI which needs to be manually tested across various operating systems. Additionally, Bitcoin Core has few design focused testers / contributors resulting in design direction of many PRs mostly being an afterthought or unfounded in design principles. 

To assist with bridging the designer / developer gap, Project Muggle will be actively testing GUI PRs. Learning's gained through testing PRs will be valuable in establishing design procedures for Bitcoin Core, as well as be useful for the wider Bitcoin community (such as contributing to the Bitcoin Design Guide). 

Project Muggle will also be aiming to encourage more users (designers or not) to start testing PRs with well designed guides and documentation (see guides and documentation sections below).



## üî¨ Research
Project Muggle conduct design research on how to best implement UI/UX features within the novel constraints Bitcoin Core products such as the GUI has. 

Project Muggle will actively collaborate with Bitcoin Core wallet research project [Project Horizon](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z2D1Wn5tkQ-Scdp0n8qm2mnFvik1wnU3vcu1DZ1f9jo/edit#) were relevant. Project Muggle will also be working alongside the Bitcoin Design community throughout its research.

<details>
  <summary>Research areas of interest</summary>
  
- Designing for Bitcoin Core post 0.21.0 ‚Äì Taproot, MuSig, descriptors and more.
- UX friendly wallet backups without BIP39.
- Multisig integration with hardened hierarchical Deterministic Wallets.
- Bitcoin Core hardware wallet integration.
- Node bootstrapping.
- Who is the GUI being designed for? 

</details>



## üñ•Ô∏è GUI Designs
Project Muggle will be actively working on improving the UI/UX of the Bitcoin Core graphical user interface (GUI). Design scope will focus on changes that will be atomic (versioned), non-contentious and translatable to future frameworks such as QML (to not incur design debt). Contributing designs will also assist with establishing design workflows and processes that integrate with the current Bitcoin Core contributing guidelines. 

Re-designing of bitcoincore.org (see section above) also falls under the umbrella of UI/UX of the GUI though this has been kept separate from this section.

Some designs may be prototyped in other open source Bitcoin Projects that have a faster developmental pace than Bitcoin Core. These projects will be labelled as segue designs.  


### QML GUI
Project Muggle will be working on a complete new QML based design for the GUI. QML offers much more design flexibility than the currently used Qt widgets framework. Switching the Qt framework to QML from widgets is still a [WIP](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16883), though designs will be worked on while this transition occurs.

Project Muggle will be applying a minimilist monochrome styling for this design which aligns with the neutral and conservative nature of the Bitcoin Core project.

**More details coming soon.**


### On-boarding wizard
Currently the Bitcoin Core GUI has a limited on-boarding process. On-boarding is a crucial step for any digital application to educate users about the product. Currently users are thrown into the GUI with little guidance. The Bitcoin Core GUI has many features that can be confusing to new users that a well crafted on-boarding process can help clarify. 

The on-boarding designs are broken up into versions. This limits technical overhead making it easier for developers to implement them. Bitcoin Core moves in calculated and incremental steps so atomising these designs is the most practical approach. 

<details>
  <summary>Version 0.1</summary>
  
Version 0.1 reworks the current, very limited on-boarding. The goal of this version is to educate the user about the GUI and running a full node. A first iteration of version 0.1 has been shared on GitHub for feedback [issue #81](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/issues/81). [Link](https://www.figma.com/file/4dO1LqPY0WAgp5d1Bz3U8j/Bitcoin-Core-Designs?node-id=1%3A15) to active design work.

</details>
 
<details>
  <summary> Version 0.2 </summary>
 
Version 0.2 will introduce a basic create wallet flow to the on boarding process proceeding what is introduced in 0.1. The goal of this version is to walk users through setting up a wallet as simply as possible. [Link](https://www.figma.com/file/4dO1LqPY0WAgp5d1Bz3U8j/Bitcoin-Core-Designs?node-id=104%3A216) to active design work.
 
</details>

<details>
  <summary> Version 0.3 </summary>
 
Version 0.3 will add to the wallet creation steps by adding descriptor import options for watch only wallets and external signer (hardware wallets) integration. 

</details>
 

### Create wallet flow
The current GUI create wallet user flow does little to educate the user about what it is they are doing. Creating a wallet is an important action all Bitcoin users undertake that has many caveats and intricacies. Without educating users through the process it's likely they will costly errors.

<details>
   <summary> Version 0.1 </summary>

Version 0.1 will focus on re-working of what content is currently available. This is to make it more clear to users about what they actions they are taking / trade offs they are making which are not clearly communicated currently. A first iteration of version 0.1 has been shared on GitHub for feedback [issue #77](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/issues/77#issue-687141626). [Link](https://www.figma.com/file/4dO1LqPY0WAgp5d1Bz3U8j/Bitcoin-Core-Designs?node-id=5%3A1)to active design work. 

</details>
 
<details>
   <summary> Version 0.2 </summary>
  
Version 0.2 will focus on adding additional features to the basic create wallet flow. Examples include external signer wallet create option and descriptor imports for watch only wallets. [Link](https://www.figma.com/file/4dO1LqPY0WAgp5d1Bz3U8j/Bitcoin-Core-Designs?node-id=158%3A0)to active design work.
  
</details>
 

### CoinControl
CoinControl in Bitcoin Core, and Bitcoin wallets in general, is still considered to be an advanced user option. The primary barrier preventing CoinControl being usable by less experienced users is bad UX. CoinControl is an important part of using Bitcoin in order to manage funds and protect your privacy. Project Muggle will be working on making CoinControl more simplified for end users and integrating our learnings into the Bitcoin Core GUI. 

[Some great discussions](https://github.com/BitcoinDesign/Guide/issues/22) and work is happening over at the Bitcoin Design community on improving CoinControl UX. Project Muggle will be contributing insights to this discussion which will result in a better CoinControl UX for Bitcoin Core as well as the wider Bitcoin ecosystem.


### Hardware wallet intergration
Project Muggle will be designing UI/UX for hardware wallet integration in the Bitcoin Core GUI. Bitcoin Core is approaching external signers in a different way to other hardware wallets so a novel UI/UX is required. Designs will include creating a wallet with an external signer and signing using an external device. This is still a [WIP](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pull/4) on the technical side but active design work will begin soon.   


### Multisig 
Project Muggle will be working on making a multisig interface for the Bitcoin Core GUI. Designs for multisig will be actively worked on once hardware wallet integration UI/UX is complete. Multisig in Bitcoin Core is quite different from other wallets (due to no BIP39 implementation) so like the hardware wallet integration this will also require a novel UI/UX approach. 


### Descriptor wallets
Descriptor wallets included in the next major Bitcoin Core release (0.21) offer a wide range of UX implications. There does not yet exist any reference UI/UX best practices for working with descriptors so designs will be novel. Some examples of UX improvements descriptors can offer are below:

- Easier multisig / wallet backups.
- Better wallet management.
